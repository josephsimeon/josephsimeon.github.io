README will contain the planning design for the website, this will be the best way to organise issue and tracking as
well as give a defined plan on how I want the website to function.

## Planning

### Features

* Header
    
    * Name<sup>1</sup>
    * Menu<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Name will be reduced to initials when the screen is not large enough.
<sup>2</sup> Menu will be a symbol that will expand to the menu selection when the screen is not large enough.
<sup>3</sup> Socials are only shown when the screen is not large enough, the socials will sit in the middle of the header.
